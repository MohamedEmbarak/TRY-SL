"""PostToolUse(Write|Edit) — the Law of Truth, enforced instead of requested.

Two checks, both mechanical:

1. Any file that states a test result must state one that reproduces. The hook
   re-runs the suite and diffs. This is finding QC-01 and QC-03 from cycle 3 as a
   script: a hand-edited "Ran 22 tests" becomes impossible to write, not merely
   possible to catch afterwards.

2. Any Python file written into deliverables/ must import only modules that
   actually resolve. An invented package is the canonical catastrophic fabrication.
   Checked by parsing the syntax tree, not by grepping the file head, so
   function-local imports are caught too.
