"""Repo-wide claim audit. Run by CI, and runnable by hand.

    python3 .claude/hooks/verify-claims.py

Walks every tracked markdown file, finds stated test results, and checks each against
an actual run of the suite. Exits non-zero on the first claim that does not reproduce.

The local hooks protect a session. This protects the repository — including from
contributors who never ran the hooks, and from claims that were true when written
and quietly expired afterwards. Staleness and fabrication are indistinguishable to
a reader; both are caught here.
