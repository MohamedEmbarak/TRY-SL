"""SubagentStop — the Law of Silence, measured.

Deliberately advisory. On this event exit 2 makes the sub-agent *keep working*,
which for a verbosity complaint would produce more text, not less — so this hook
never blocks. It measures, records to the evidence ledger, and hands the
orchestrator a number it did not have to trust anyone for.

The Doctrine's budgets: employee and senior cycle reports ≤6 lines, free-form
commentary ≤3 lines. A Lead Rollup carries three sections plus tables; 60 lines is
generous for that and still catches an essay.
